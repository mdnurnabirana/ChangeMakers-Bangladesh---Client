## 🚀 Project Overview
**ChangeMakers Bangladesh** is a full-stack, modern platform that connects passionate volunteers with real social service events across Bangladesh - from roadside cleanups and tree plantations to donation drives, blood camps, and educational initiatives.

The application empowers anyone to discover upcoming events, join causes they care about, create their own initiatives, and manage them efficiently - all through an intuitive, responsive, and visually inspiring interface.

Built with a production-grade tech stack, secure authentication, protected routes, MongoDB-backed filtering/searching, dark mode, and smooth animations, this project demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development expertise.
